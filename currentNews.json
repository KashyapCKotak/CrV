Bitwise is not the first company to try and register a cryptocurrency ETF application. Earlier this month, waves were made when an application for a Bitcoin ETF from the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust was not rejected as it had been in 2017, and was instead consulted upon with industry professionals. Following this period, the SEC posted the application for public comment to see if general consumers and traders showed interest. The application received positive feedback, and the SEC later announced that it was working on an outline for newer, less-restrictive legislation regarding open-ended ETFs to increase innovation in the financial space.

Bithumb and Coinrail were hacked earlier this year, while tax authorities have raided Coinone on tax evasion allegations.Binance seems to be undeterred by all this, as it has been laying the groundwork for its expansion into South Korea for a while.

Jeon Ah-rim and Choi Hyung-won were hired as local marketing director and director of its social impact fund, Binance Lab, respectively.Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily volume is always expanding as it seeks to achieve its goal of earning $1 billion in net profit in 2018.
